# Instruction

Updated information: You can directly knock me via WhatsApp if you feel the urgent need. You already have my phone numbers. However, if it is something that you need to show me, then the better approach would be to utilize emails.

Make sure to write the mail subject in this way: `(ICS-N) .......subject.....`

Please try to write relevant subject as it helps me to identify the issue quickly before opening the email.

## Counselling 

I will update the counselling hour later. In the meantime, if you need me, then you can utilize the mail. Let me know beforehand if you want my counseling hour in my room (935). I will make sure to give you a free time slot then. If you can't find me in my room even after that, then you can let me know via WhatsApp or in emergency, directly call me!

## Group Chat

A group chat has been created and till now, we have a CR (Class Representative) named **Md. Ali Mridha Omi**.

The joining link is given **[here](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Gn19ezgEwR43LEmKbYCcNg).**

If you need any help, then you can directly reach out to me. I always try to be helpful towards you as a faculty, you all are my responsibility.

## Feedback Form

You will get a feedback form after each class, and you would need to fill that up. You should be completely honest in your feedback, and I won't even judge anyone for their feedback/comments. You can even scold me if you want there (I am serious!).

Let's try to make this lab class as much enjoyable as we can. 

Lastly, dear my **GenZ** students. Wishing you the best of luck. Congratulations on your amazing journey and career opportunity ahead.


## Course Curriculum

It may be changed. I will let you know with the updated ones as soon as possible.
